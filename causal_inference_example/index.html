<p>You will probably be intrigued by the title of this post. In this notebook I do not want to present a fancy data science trick or to test a novel technique. I would simply like to tell a story. A story about how data science can be used to make bad decisions. “How can this be?” you might ask. Everyone has been saying that data is the way to unlock insights to gain a competitive advantage. Well, it is true. But it is also true that data can be used to make decisions that can actually hurt your business. There are many possible reasons you could think of (and you might even have experienced some of them). The story I am about to tell won’t be about bad algorithms or bad data. It will be about thinking about data as simply</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{data in} \rightarrow \text{ML model} \rightarrow \text{data out} \rightarrow \text{decision}
\]</span></p>
<p>instead of thinking about the data generating process. In other words, it will be about not thinking about <strong>causality</strong>.</p>
<div id="the-business-problem" class="section level3">
<h3>The Business Problem</h3>
<p>The story begins in a fast paced startup. The company is growing fast and the marketing team is looking for ways to increase the sales from existing customers by making them buy more. The main idea is to unlock the potential of the customer base through incentives, in this case a discount. We of course want to measure the effect of the discount on the customer’s behavior. Still, they do not want to waste money giving discounts to users which are not valuable. As always, it is about return on investment (ROI). Without going into specifics about the nature of the discount, it has been designed to provide a positive return on investment if the customer buys more than <span class="math inline">\(1\$\)</span> as a result of the discount. How can we measure the effect of the discount and make sure our experiment has a positive ROI? The marketing team came up with the following strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a sample of existing customers from the same cohort.</li>
<li>Set a test window of 1 month.</li>
<li>Look into the historical data of web visits from the last month. The hypothesis is that web visits are a good proxy for the customer’s interest in the product.</li>
<li>For customers with a high number of web visits, send them a discount. There will be a hold out group which will not receive the discount within the potential valuable customers based on the number of web visits. For customers with a low number of web visits, do not send them a discount (the marketing team wants to report a positive ROI, so they do not want to waste money on customers which are not valuable). Still, they want to use them to measure the effect of the discount.</li>
<li>We also want to use the results of the test to tag <em>loyal</em> customers. These are customers which got a discount (since they showed potential interest in the product) and customers with exceptional sales numbers even if they did not get a discount. The idea is to use this information to target them in the future if the discount strategy is positive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>The team collected data from the experiment above and asked the data science team to analyze it and provide insights. In particular, they want to know if they should keep the discount strategy. The data consists of the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>visits</code>: Number of visits to the website during the test window.</li>
<li><code>discount</code>: Whether the customer received a discount or not.</li>
<li><code>is_loyal</code>: Whether the customer is loyal or not according to the definition above.</li>
<li><code>sales</code>: Sales in <span class="math inline">\(\$\)</span> during the test window.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>The Analysis</h3>
<p>Now that the context, objectives and data are clear, let’s look into the story about a relatively innocent analysis which turn out to be a pain and whose outcome and final decision was not the best one. But hey, do not worry, we will learn from it!</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>As part of the project scope, the data science team in charge of the analysis was asked to provide a summary of the data. The team was also asked to provide a visualization of the data to help the marketing team understand the data better. Data scientist A took over this task. They started by looking at the share of customers which received a discount:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>data[&quot;discount&quot;].value_counts() / len(data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>discount
1    0.74
0    0.26
Name: count, dtype: float64</code></pre>
<p>Similarly for the share of customers which are loyal:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>data[&quot;is_loyal&quot;].value_counts() / len(data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>is_loyal
1    0.75
0    0.25
Name: count, dtype: float64</code></pre>
<p>To understand these features better, they also looked at a cross-tab table:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>pd.crosstab(data[&quot;discount&quot;], data[&quot;is_loyal&quot;])</code></pre>
<center>
<div>
<style scoped>

<p>Note that all customers with discount are loyal (as required) and that there are loyal users which did not receive a discount. This is because they had exceptional sales numbers. Let’s verify this:</p>

<p>The loyal customers are the top ones in terms of sales. This is good news. It means that the definition of loyal customers is consistent with the data.</p>
<p>In order to have orders of magnitude for the sales, the data scientist provided some summary statistics table:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>data[&quot;sales&quot;].describe()</code></pre>
<pre><code>count    700.000000
mean      19.400159

50%       19.495469
75%       22.500405
max       36.136312
Name: sales, dtype: float64</code></pre>
<p>To have a better glimpse of the data, the data scientist also provided a histogram of the sales:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>g = sns.displot(
    data=data, x=&quot;sales&quot;, kind=&quot;hist&quot;, kde=True, fill=True, height=5, aspect=1.5
)

<div id="descriptive-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Descriptive Statistics</h2>
<p>Data scientist A feels comfortable with the data and decides to move on to the discount analysis. The first thing they did was to split the sales distribution by discount group:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>g = sns.displot(
    data=data,
    x=&quot;sales&quot;,
    kind=&quot;hist&quot;,
    hue=&quot;discount&quot;,
    kde=True,

<center>
<img src="../images/causal_inference_example_files/causal_inference_example_22_2.png" style="width: 900px;"/>
</center>
<p>It looks customers with discount have higher sales. Data scientist A is optimistic with this initial result. To quantify this, they computed the difference in means:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>data.groupby([&quot;discount&quot;]).agg({&quot;sales&quot;: &quot;mean&quot;})
</code></pre>

<p>Wow! We see <span class="math inline">\(4.8\$\)</span> mean uplift! This is great news. The discount strategy seems to be working. Data scientist A is happy with the results and decides to get feedback from the rest of the data science team.</p>
<p>Data scientist B is not so happy with the results. They think that the uplift is too good to be true (based on domain knowledge and the sales distributions 🤔). When thinking about reasons for such a high uplift, they realized the discount assignment was not at random. It was based on the number of web visits (remember the marketing plan?). This means that the discount group is not comparable to the control group completely! They decide to plot sales against web visits per discount group:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>g = sns.relplot(data=data, x=&quot;visits&quot;, y=&quot;sales&quot;, hue=&quot;is_loyal&quot;, col=&quot;discount&quot;)
g.fig.suptitle(&quot;Sales vs. Visits&quot;, y=1.05, fontsize=18, fontweight=&quot;bold&quot;)</code></pre>
<center>
<img src="../images/causal_inference_example_files/causal_inference_example_27_2.png" style="width: 1000px;"/>
</center>
<p>Indeed, they realize they should probably adjust for the number of web visits. A natural metric is sales per web visit. Let’s compute it:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>data.groupby([&quot;discount&quot;]).agg({&quot;sales_per_visit&quot;: &quot;mean&quot;})
</code></pre>
<center>
<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

<p>The mean value is higher for the discount group. As always, they also looked at the distributions:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>g = sns.displot(
    data=data,
    x=&quot;sales_per_visit&quot;,
    kind=&quot;hist&quot;,
    hue=&quot;discount&quot;,
    kde=True,
    fill=True,
    height=5,
    aspect=1.5,
)
g.fig.suptitle(

<center>
<img src="../images/causal_inference_example_files/causal_inference_example_31_2.png" style="width: 900px;"/>
</center>
<p>For both data scientist the results look much better, but they were unsure about which uplift to report. They thought about the difference in means:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>(
    data.query(&quot;discount == 1&quot;)[&quot;sales_per_visit&quot;].mean()
    - data.query(&quot;discount == 0&quot;)[&quot;sales_per_visit&quot;].mean()
)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>0.07705031597862955</code></pre>
<p>However, how to interpret this value in terms of dollars? When thinking about what and how to report to the marketing team, data scientist C came and strongly suggested to also control for loyalty as the discount strategy was designed to define (target?) loyal customers. Data scientists A and B agreed, but they were not sure about how to do this. To get some inspiration, they looked at some additional descriptive statistics and plots splitting by loyalty level.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>g = sns.displot(
    data=data,
    x=&quot;sales&quot;,
    hue=&quot;discount&quot;,
    row=&quot;is_loyal&quot;,
    kde=True,
    height=3.5,
    aspect=2.5,
)

for i, ax in enumerate(g.axes.flatten()):
    df = data.query(f&quot;is_loyal == {i}&quot;)
    for discount in range(2):
        mean = df.query(f&quot;discount == {discount}&quot;)[&quot;sales&quot;].mean()
        ax.axvline(
            x=df.query(f&quot;discount == {discount}&quot;)[&quot;sales&quot;].mean(),
            color=f&quot;C{discount}&quot;,
            linestyle=&quot;--&quot;,
            label=f&quot;mean = {mean: .3f}&quot;,
        )
        ax.legend(loc=&quot;upper right&quot;)

<p>Ok! This was shocking! They saw that for the loyal customers the sales are much (much!) higher for the non-discounted group! How could this be? We do see a clear difference in sales between loyal an non-loyal users conditioned on no-discount:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>(
    data.query(&quot;discount == 0 &amp; is_loyal == 1&quot;)[&quot;sales&quot;].mean()
    - data.query(&quot;discount == 0 &amp; is_loyal == 0&quot;)[&quot;sales&quot;].mean()
)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>12.631180501353883</code></pre>
<p>So the loyalty feature should not be the problem right? Still, the <code>loyal</code> tag depends on the discount, so maybe this is implicitly providing an uplift? In view of the sales distribution and the expectation of the experiments, this looks way to good to be true. The data scientist were very hesitant to recommend pushing discounts to non-loyal customers as a result of a <span class="math inline">\(12\$\)</span> uplift in sales. Stakeholders would probably not buy this as the overall average sales per user was around <span class="math inline">\(20\$\)</span>.</p>
<p>Data scientist B noticed that the plots above did not factor in the <code>visits</code> variable. Hence, they decided to run the analogous plots on the <code>sales_per_visit</code> variable:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>g = sns.displot(
    data=data,
    x=&quot;sales_per_visit&quot;,
    hue=&quot;discount&quot;,
    row=&quot;is_loyal&quot;,
    kde=True,
    height=3.5,
    aspect=2.5,
)

for i, ax in enumerate(g.axes.flatten()):
    df = data.query(f&quot;is_loyal == {i}&quot;)
    for discount in range(2):
        mean = df.query(f&quot;discount == {discount}&quot;)[&quot;sales_per_visit&quot;].mean()
        ax.axvline(
            x=mean,
            color=f&quot;C{discount}&quot;,
            linestyle=&quot;--&quot;,
            label=f&quot;mean = {mean: .3f}&quot;,
        )
        ax.legend(loc=&quot;upper right&quot;)

g.fig.suptitle(
    &quot;Sales per visit distribution by discount and loyalty&quot;,
    y=1.05,
    fontsize=18,
    fontweight=&quot;bold&quot;,
)</code></pre>
<center>
<img src="../images/causal_inference_example_files/causal_inference_example_39_2.png" style="width: 1000px;"/>
</center>
<p>This plots shows a different story! It seems that loyal customers do react positively to the discount strategy. Also, when just looking to the non-discounted group, they saw the loyal customers had a higher <code>sales_per_visit</code> value.</p>

<h2>A Simple Bayesian Linear Regression</h2>
<p>At this point, the three data scientists were very confused as they had found contradictory results regarding the discount effect on sales. Data scientist D came with a very reasonable suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of trying to find the best way to report the results, why don’t we try to model the data through a linear model? This way, we can include all the control variables as covariates. We can even use bayesian statistics to present our estimation with uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone agreed and they decided to fit a simple Bayesian linear regression model. The data scientist are familiar with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808">bayesian workflow</a>. Here is what they did:</p>

<h2>A Machine Learning Approach</h2>
<p>Fortunately, data scientist E came with an alternative approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You folks are trying to make sense of complex relationships by looking at simple plots and summary statistics. Why don’t you try to fit a machine learning model to the data and see what happens? This way we can simply let the data and the model figure out the relationships between the variables. We can do a post-processing on the predictions using, for example, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/partial_dependence.html">partial dependency plots</a>: which <em>show the marginal effect one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model</em>. (see <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html">here</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone was thrilled! They would impress everyone with a machine learning model 🤓!</p>
<p>The strategy was now simple: train a non-linear machine learning model (as they were expecting complex relationships) and use partial dependency plots to estimate the discount effect. As good data scientists, they would also use cross-validation to avoid over-fitting, despite the fact they were not interested in out-of-sample predictions.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># specify variables.
# we use all the variables in the dataset to reduce the variance of
# the estimates (what could go wrong right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ?).
numeric_features = [&quot;visits&quot;]

features = numeric_features + categorical_features

# define the model data.
X = data.assign(
    discount=lambda x: pd.Categorical(values=x[&quot;discount&quot;], categories=[0, 1]),
    is_loyal=lambda x: pd.Categorical(values=x[&quot;is_loyal&quot;], categories=[0, 1]),

<h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
<p>Based on the results from the linear model and the machine learning model, the data scientist decided to recommend the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stop the discount strategy as on average it provides less than <span class="math inline">\(1\$\)</span> additional sales, which implies a negative ROI</strong>.</p>

<h1>Part 2: The Mistake and Learnings</h1>
<p>What if I told you that the true average discount effect is <span class="math inline">\(2\$\)</span> and therefore the best strategy is to keep the discount strategy? How do I know it? Well, I generated the data (see <a href="https://github.com/juanitorduz/website_projects/blob/master/Python/sales_dag.py">here</a>). Do not take me wrong, I generated the data exactly as it was designed to be from the requirements listed at the very beginning. So what went wrong? What did the data scientist miss? If you are thinking about using more sophisticated models, you are wrong. The problem is not the model, but the data understanding.</p>
<p>Let me bring again the description of the campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a sample of existing customers from the same cohort.</li>
<li>Set a test window of 1 month.</li>
<li>Look into the historical data of web visits from the last month. The hypothesis is that web visits are a good proxy for the customer’s interest in the product.</li>
<li>For customers with a high number of web visits, send them a discount. There will be a hold out group which will not receive the discount within the potential valuable customers based on the number of web visits. For customers with a low number of web visits, do not send them a discount (the marketing team wants to report a positive ROI, so they do not want to waste money on customers which are not valuable). Still, they want to use them to measure the effect of the discount.</li>
<li>We also want to use the results of the test to cluster tag <em>loyal</em> customers. These are customers which got a discount (since they showed potential interest in the product) and customers with exceptional sales numbers even if they did not get a discount. The idea is to use this information to target them in the future if the discount strategy is positive.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is always recommended to truly understand the implications and assumptions of the data generating process. A data structure which visually an analytically can support this understanding is a DAG (directed acyclic graph). Here is the DAG for the data generating process of the campaign:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>g = gr.Digraph()
g.node(name=&quot;sales&quot;, label=&quot;sales&quot;, color=&quot;deepskyblue&quot;, style=&quot;filled&quot;)
g.node(name=&quot;discount&quot;, label=&quot;discount&quot;, color=&quot;deeppink&quot;, style=&quot;filled&quot;)
g.edge(tail_name=&quot;discount&quot;, head_name=&quot;sales&quot;)
g.edge(tail_name=&quot;visits&quot;, head_name=&quot;discount&quot;)
g.edge(tail_name=&quot;visits&quot;, head_name=&quot;sales&quot;)
g.edge(tail_name=&quot;discount&quot;, head_name=&quot;is_loyal&quot;)
g.edge(tail_name=&quot;sales&quot;, head_name=&quot;is_loyal&quot;)
g</code></pre>
<center>
<img src="../images/causal_inference_example_files/causal_inference_example_70_0.svg" style="width: 300px;"/>
</center>
<p>The following are the main structural remarks from the DAG:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the discounts (treatment) and sales (target) are affected by the number of web visits (proxy for customer’s interest in the product). This means that the number of web visits is a confounder variable.</li>
<li>However, the loyalty of the customer is defined by both the discounts and the sales. This means that loyalty is a collider variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds strange to you, is ok, the causal inference jargon is not easy to understand at the beginning (please see the <strong>References</strong> section below). What is important is that the <code>visits</code> variable is a confounding variable which is important to control for because it is creating a bias as we are actively giving more discounts to more engaged users. However, on the other hand, the <code>is_loyal</code> variable is a collider variable which is creating an spurious relationship between the <code>discount</code> and <code>sales</code> variables. <strong>This was the data scientists mistake!</strong> Note that we do not care if we estimate effect with a linear model or a gradient boosting tree ensemble, the problem is the features we select for the model!</p>

</div>
<div id="learnings" class="section level2">
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this example shows the importance of understanding the data generating process and the assumptions behind it. In the example above, we saw how ignoring this aspect can lead to wrong conclusions which can actually hurt business decisions and potentially cost a lot of money. Here is a summary of the learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the data generating process and the assumptions behind the causal relations (do not forget the potential unobservable variables, these can also create problems when ignored!).</li>
<li>DAGs are a great tool for this.</li>
<li>Adding all available features is generally not a good idea, specially for inference purposes.</li>
<li>Nor simpler nor more complex models can save you from bad data understanding.</li>
<li>Machine learning models are not always the solution for applied data science problems.</li>
<li>Inference and prediction tasks are different (see <a href="https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/18-Heterogeneous-Treatment-Effects-and-Personalization.html">here</a> for another use case showing this).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> In many ways this example is an over-simplification of a real world application. In practice, one is more interested in the <em>conditional average treatment effect</em>, to identify users which are more likely to be influenced by the treatment. This is a more complex problem, which requires more data and more sophisticated models. See for example <a href="https://juanitorduz.github.io/uplift/">PyConDE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022: Introduction to Uplift Modeling</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-churn-prediction-and-churn-uplift-45225e5a7541">Beyond Churn Prediction and Churn Uplift</a>). However, the main message of this example still holds: understanding the data generating process and the assumptions behind it is crucial for causal inference.</p>

<h2>Appending A: Causal Inference Software</h2>
<p>In this concrete example it was relatively easy to extract the subset of good control variables. In most complex cases (common in applications), this can be a very difficult task. Fortunately, there are some software packages which can help you with this task. Here I illustrate how to do it using the <a href="https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.9.1/"><code>dowhy</code></a> library (and the great book <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/1804612987?utm_term=2023_06&amp;utm_campaign=causalpython_links&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;language=en_US&amp;utm_source=webpage&amp;linkCode=gg2&amp;linkId=842a3ff0187e800a338f20d3ce81352b&amp;tag=alxndrmlk00-20">Causal Inference and Discovery in Python: Unlock the secrets of modern causal machine learning with DoWhy, EconML, PyTorch and more</a>).</p>
<p>As a first step we need to specify the DAG in <a href="https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/gml-format/">gml format</a>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>gml_graph = &quot;&quot;&quot;
graph [
    directed 1
    
    node [
        id &quot;discount&quot;
        label &quot;discount&quot;

        target &quot;is_loyal&quot;
    ]
]
&quot;&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can simply initialize the <code>CausalModel</code> object.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from dowhy import CausalModel

model = CausalModel(
    data=data,

<img src="../images/causal_inference_example_files/causal_inference_example_98_0.png" style="width: 800px;"/>
</center>
<p>DoWhy provides a rich set of mechanisms to estimate the causal effects. We can use the <code>identify_effect</code> method to get a list of the potential methods.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>estimand = model.identify_effect()

print(estimand)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Estimand type: nonparametric-ate

### Estimand : 1
Estimand name: backdoor
Estimand expression:
     d

### Estimand : 2
Estimand name: iv
No such variable(s) found!

### Estimand : 3
Estimand name: frontdoor
No such variable(s) found!</code></pre>
<p>In this case we will use the <code>backdoor</code> method. In essence, this method will use the backdoor criterion to identify the set of good control variables and then run a (linear) regression model to estimate the causal effect. Let’s see how to get the list of good control variables we need to consider:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>estimand.get_backdoor_variables()
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[&#39;visits&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>As expected, the <code>is_loyal</code> variable does not appear in the list.</p>
<p>Note that the backdoor criterion is a graph property. Hence, we can hack the API to access the graph attribute to obtain a rich set of methods to analyze it. For example, we can get all the valid backdoor paths:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>model._graph.get_backdoor_paths(nodes1=[&quot;discount&quot;], nodes2=[&quot;sales&quot;])</code></pre>
<pre><code>[[&#39;discount&#39;, &#39;visits&#39;, &#39;sales&#39;]]</code></pre>
<p>We can also check for valid control sets:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>model._graph.check_valid_backdoor_set(
    nodes1=[&quot;discount&quot;], nodes2=[&quot;sales&quot;], nodes3=[&quot;visits&quot;]
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>{&#39;is_dseparated&#39;: True}</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>model._graph.check_valid_backdoor_set(
    nodes1=[&quot;discount&quot;], nodes2=[&quot;sales&quot;], nodes3=[&quot;is_loyal&quot;]
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>{&#39;is_dseparated&#39;: False}</code></pre>
<p>After selecting the estimand, we can proceed to estimate the causal effect:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>estimate = model.estimate_effect(
    identified_estimand=estimand,
    method_name=&quot;backdoor.linear_regression&quot;,
    target_units=&quot;ate&quot;,
    test_significance=True,
    confidence_intervals=True,
)

print(f&quot;Estimate of causal effect (linear regression): {estimate.value}&quot;)
print(f&quot;confidence interval: {estimate.get_confidence_intervals()}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Estimate of causal effect (linear regression): 1.855502783142704
confidence interval: [[1.51720297 2.1938026 ]]</code></pre>
<p>The results are very similar to what we obtained with the linear Bayesian linear regression model above.</p>
<p>This library allow us to challenge the graph structure using the data though a family of <em>refuters</em>. See <a href="https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.8/user_guide/effect_inference/refute.html">Refute the obtained estimate</a> from the documentation for more details. For example, we can use the <em>data subset</em> refuter to check if the causal effect is robust when estimating it on a subset of the data:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>refute_subset = model.refute_estimate(
    estimand=estimand,
    estimate=estimate,
    method_name=&quot;data_subset_refuter&quot;,
    subset_fraction=0.7,
    random_state=rng,
    verbose=0,
)

print(refute_subset)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Refute: Use a subset of data
Estimated effect:1.855502783142704
New effect:1.8914110130354584
p value:0.86</code></pre>
<p>We do see that the causal effect is stable to the data subset.</p>
<p>We can also add a common cause variable (for both the treatment and the target). The results should not change:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>refute_random_common_cause = model.refute_estimate(
    estimand=estimand,
    estimate=estimate,
    method_name=&quot;random_common_cause&quot;,
    random_state=rng,
    verbose=0,
)

print(refute_random_common_cause)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Refute: Add a random common cause
Estimated effect:1.855502783142704
New effect:1.8554656228906183
p value:0.94</code></pre>
<p>The results are indeed the same.</p>

</div>
<div id="appendix-b-ml-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Appendix B: ML Model</h2>
<p>Here we revisit the machine learning model approach with the right set of features.</p>

</center>
<p>The result is much closer that the complete model. Note however that estimated effect through partial dependency plots is below the true effect. This is might because there there is a relationship between the <code>discount</code> and <code>visits</code> variable. This will induce non-realistic points to be evaluated during the marginalization. This is a common problem with partial dependency plots. In general, I do not recommend using them for causal inference purposes. I recommend to use them for post-processing/understanding of purely predictions models (acknowledging their limitations).</p>
