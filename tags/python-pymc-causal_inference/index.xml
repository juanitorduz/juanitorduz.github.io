      <description>Estimating causal effects from clustered or grouped data requires careful attention to the hierarchical structure of observations. When units are nested within groups such as students within classrooms, or patients within hospitals—ignoring this structure can lead to incorrect standard errors, inefficient estimates, and invalid causal inferences. Multilevel models provide a principled framework for handling such data while leveraging the advantages of partial pooling across groups.
This notebook reproduces and extends the analysis from Chapter 23 of Gelman and Hill’s “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models”.</description>

      <description>Causal inference asks a deceptively simple question: “What would have happened if things were different?” Whether we’re evaluating a job training program, testing a new medical treatment, or analyzing the impact of a policy change, we want to understand the causal effect of an intervention not just observe correlations in the data.
Traditional statistical methods often struggle with causal questions because they conflate correlation with causation. When confounders variables that affect both treatment assignment and outcomes are present, naive comparisons can lead us astray.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been thinking a lot about data-driven decision-making, particularly in the context of experimentation. Why? I am uncomfortable with the common practice of using p-values and frequentist null hypothesis significance testing to make decisions. I don’t feel confident about the approach. I think it is because I do not get it. For instance, when I am forced to explain the definition of a confidence interval precisely, it does not come naturally.</description>
