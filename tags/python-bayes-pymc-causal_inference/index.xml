      <description>This notebook is a continuation of the previous notebook on ATE estimation for binary data with logistic regression based on the sequence of (great!) posts by Solomon Kurz. In this notebook, we will focus on count data. We reproduce in python an example presented in the post Causal inference with count regression by Solomon Kurz. Our intention is to simply show how to port these type of model to bambi.</description>

      <title>ATE Estimation with Logistic Regression</title>

      <description>In this notebook, I want to reproduce some components of the extensive blog post Causal inference with Bayesian models by Solomon Kurz. Specifically, I want to deep dive into the logistic regression model used to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of the study Internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection (e-STI) testing and results service: A randomised, single-blind, controlled trial by Wilson, et.al. I can only recommend to read the original sequence of posts Solomon has written on causal inference.</description>
