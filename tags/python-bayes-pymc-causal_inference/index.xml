      <description>In this notebook, I want to reproduce some components of the extensive blog post Causal inference with Bayesian models by Solomon Kurz. Specifically, I want to deep dive into the logistic regression model used to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of the study Internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection (e-STI) testing and results service: A randomised, single-blind, controlled trial by Wilson, et.al. I can only recommend to read the original sequence of posts Solomon has written on causal inference.</description>
