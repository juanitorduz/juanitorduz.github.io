      <description>In this notebook we want to reproduce a classical example of using Gaussian processes to model time series data: The birthdays data set. I first encountered this example in the seminal book Chapter 21, Bayesian Data Analysis (Third edition) when learning about the subject. One thing I rapidly realized was that fitting these types of models in practice is very computationally expensive and sometimes almost infeasible for real industry applications where the data size is larger than all of these academic examples.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Regression Coefficients via Hilbert Space Gaussian Process Approximation</title>

      <description>In this notebook we present an example of a regression model with time varying coefficients using Gaussian processes. In particular, we use a Hilbert space Gaussian process approximation in pymc to speed up the computations (see HSGP). We continue using the bikes dataset from the previous posts (Exploring Tools for Interpretable Machine Learning and Time-Varying Regression Coefficients via Gaussian Random Walk in PyMC). Please refer to those posts for more details on the dataset, EDA and base models.</description>

      <description>In this notebook we want to illustrate how to use PyMC to fit a time-varying coefficient regression model. The motivation comes from post Exploring Tools for Interpretable Machine Learning where we studied a time series problem, regarding the prediction of the number of bike rentals, from a machine learning perspective. Concretely, we fitted and compared two machine learning models: a linear regression with interactions and a gradient boost model (XGBoost).</description>
