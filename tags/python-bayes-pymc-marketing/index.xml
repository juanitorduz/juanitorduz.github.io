      <title>A Simple Cohort Retention Analysis in PyMC</title>

      <description>In this notebook we present a simple approach to study cohort retention analysis through a simulated data set. The aim is to understand how retention rates change over time and provide a simple model to predict them (with uncertainty estimates!). We do not expect this technique to be a silver bullet for all retention problems, but rather a simple approach to get started with the problem.
Remark: A motivation for this notebook was the great post Bayesian Age/Period/Cohort Models in Python with PyMC by Austin Rochford.</description>
