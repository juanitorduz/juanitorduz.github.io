      <title>Cohort Revenue &amp; Retention Analysis: A Bayesian Approach</title>

      <description>In this notebook we extend the cohort retention model presented in the post Cohort Retention Analysis with BART so that we just model retention and per cohort simultaneously (we recommend reading the referenced post before this one). The idea is to keep modeling the retention using a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model (see pymc-bart) and linearly model the revenue per cohort using a Gamma distribution. We couple the retention and revenue components in a similar way as presented in the notebook Introduction to Bayesian A/B Testing.</description>

      <description>In this notebook we study an alternative approach for the cohort analysis problem presented in A Simple Cohort Retention Analysis in PyMC. Instead of using a linear model to estimate the retention rate, we use a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model(see pymc-bart). The BART model is a flexible non-parametric model that can be used to model complex relationships between the response and the predictors.

      <title>A Simple Cohort Retention Analysis in PyMC</title>

      <description>In this notebook we present a simple approach to study cohort retention analysis through a simulated data set. The aim is to understand how retention rates change over time and provide a simple model to predict them (with uncertainty estimates!). We do not expect this technique to be a silver bullet for all retention problems, but rather a simple approach to get started with the problem.
Remark: A motivation for this notebook was the great post Bayesian Age/Period/Cohort Models in Python with PyMC by Austin Rochford.</description>
