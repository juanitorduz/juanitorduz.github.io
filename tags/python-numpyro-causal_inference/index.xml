      <description>In many demand forecasting problems, we face the challenge of predicting the demand for a product or service with very sparse data. This is especially true in retail, where many products are only sold occasionally. This sparsity can come from many sources, as greatly described in the (recommended!) blog post “Why zeroes happen” by Ivan Svetunkov. On one hand, the sparsity can simply come from the lack of demand for the product.</description>

      <title>Bayesian CUPED &amp; Sensitivity Analysis</title>

      <description>Motivated by the great blog post by Understanding CUPED by Matteo Courthoud, we explore a Bayesian approach to CUPED to understand its sensitivity with respect to the covariance parameter \(\theta\) of the pre-post mean model. I will assume that the reader is already familiar with CUPED and has read Matteo’s blog post (highly recommended!). Here we focus on the sensitivity component. We do not do this in full generality but rather focus on the specific example of Matteo’s blog post.</description>
