      <title>Open Data: Berlin Kitas</title>

      <description>In this notebook I want to explore some data I found on the Berlin Open Data portal daten.berlin.de. The data source contains information of Kitas (Kindertagesstätte, i.e. kindergartens) in Berlin. This is a big topic as finding a spot in a Kita is extremely difficult. We first provide an initial exploratory data analysis of the data set, then we merge it with population data to create some geo-location maps. In our way we do not expect to answer on how to find a Kita, but rather simpler questions about their location distribution and sizes.</description>

      <description>In this post we want to revisit a simple bayesian inference example worked out in this blog post. This time we want to use TensorFlow Probability (TFP) instead of PyMC3.

      <description>In this notebook I want to collect some useful visualizations which can help model development and model evaluation in the context of regression analysis. I use many visualization resources not just only to share results but as a key component of my workflow: data QA, EDA, feature engineering, model development, model evaluation and communicating results. In this notebook I focus on a simple regression model (time series) with statsmodels and visualization with matplotlib and seaborn.</description>

      <description>In this notebook we want to go take a look into the distributions module of TensorFlow probability. The aim is to understand the fundamentals and then explore further this probabilistic programming framework. Here you can find an overview of TensorFlow Probability. We will concentrate on the first part of Layer 1: Statistical Building Blocks. As you could see from the distributions module documentation, there are many classes of distributions. We will explore a small sample of them in order to get an overall overview.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to explore the ideas behind spectral clustering. I do not intend to develop the theory. Instead, I will unravel a practical example to illustrate and motivate the intuition behind each step of the spectral clustering algorithm. I particularly recommend two references:
 For an introduction/overview on the theory, see the lecture notes A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering by Prof. Dr. Ulrike von Luxburg. For a concrete application of this clustering method you can see the PyData’s talk: Extracting relevant Metrics with Spectral Clustering by Dr.</description>

      <title>The Volume of the d-Ball via Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <guid>/vol_d_ball/</guid>
      <description>In this notebook we run Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the volume of the \(d\)-ball \[ B^{d}:=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d : ||x|| \leq 1\}. \] There are many ways to obtain a closed formula for this volume , see for example this Wikipedia article. Here we do it via sampling just for fun!
Main Idea Consider a square \(A_{d}\subset \mathbb{R}\) centered at the origin with side length \(2\). We estimate the volume of the \(d\)-ball \(B^{d}:=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d : ||x|| \leq 1\}\subset A^{d}\) by sampling uniformly from \(A\) and computing the proportions of vectors having length less or equal than one.</description>

      <description>In this notebook we are present an initial exploration of the Prophet package by Facebook. From the documentation:
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.</description>

      <description>In this notebook we explore the Structural Time Series (STS) Module of TensorFlow Probability. We follow closely the use cases presented in their Medium blog. As described there: An STS model expresses an observed time series as the sum of simpler components 1:
\[ f(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{N}f_{k}(t) + \varepsilon, \quad \text{where}\quad \varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2). \]
Each summand \(f_{k}(t)\) has a particular structure, e.g. specific seasonality, trend, autoregressive terms, etc.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to show how to use public available (open) data to create geo visualizations in python. Maps are a great way to communicate and compare information when working with geolocation data. There are many frameworks to plot maps, here I focus on matplotlib and geopandas (and give a glimpse of mplleaflet).
Reference: A very good introduction to matplotlib is the chapter on Visualization with Matplotlib from the Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas.</description>

      <description>In this blog post I want to describe the explicit computation of the Laplacian on differential forms on the \(2\)-Torus \(T^2\subset \mathbb{R}^3\). This surface can be obtained by rotating the circle \((x-a)^2+y^2=r^2\) around the \(z\)-axis (\(0&amp;lt;r&amp;lt;a\)). Locally, this surface can be parametrized by the equations \[ x = (a+r\cos u)\cos v,\\ y = (a+r\cos u)\sin v,\\ z = r\sin u, \]
where \(0&amp;lt;u,v&amp;lt;2\pi\).</description>

      <description>Updated Version: 2019/09/21 (Extension + Minor Corrections)

We follow this reference very closely (and encourage to read it!). Our main objective is to illustrate the concepts and results through a concrete example. We use PyMC3 to run bayesian sampling.

This is a first step towards exploring and understanding Gaussian Processes methods in machine learning.
Multivariate Normal Distribution Recall that a random vector \(X = (X_1, \cdots, X_d)\) has a multivariate normal (or Gaussian) distribution if every linear combination
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{d} a_iX_i, \quad a_i\in\mathbb{R} $$ is normally distributed.</description>

      <description>The objective of this post is to explore MathJax, a JavaScript display engine for LaTeX. Being my first post writen with this tool, I want to present a short but fun example: I will give a description of the explicit computation of the spin-Dirac operator (of the unique complex spinor bundle!) on the 2-sphere \(S^2\) equipped with the standar round metric. A more detailed treatment can be found in my expository paper.</description>
