      <title>satRday Berlin 2019: Remedies for Severe Class Imbalance</title>

      <description>In this post I present a concrete case study illustrating some techniques to improve model performance in class-imbalanced classification problems. The methodologies described here are based on Chapter 16: Remedies for Severe Class Imbalance of the (great!) book Applied Predictive Modeling by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. I absolutely recommend this reference to anyone interested in predictive modeling.
This notebook should serve as an extension of my talk given at satRday Berlin 2019: A conference for R users in Berlin.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Theorem for Matrices</title>

      <description>When working in data analysis it is almost impossible to avoid using linear algebra, even if it is on the background, e.g. simple linear regression. In this post I want to discuss one of the most important theorems of finite dimensional vector spaces: the spectral theorem. The objective is not to give a complete and rigorous treatment of the subject, but rather show the main ingredients, some examples and applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Curse of Dimensionality - Part II.</title>

      <description>I continue exploring the curse of dimensionality. Following the analysis form Part I., I want to discuss another consequence of sparse sampling in high dimensions: sample points are close to an edge of the sample. This post is based on The Elements of Statistical Learning, Section 2.5, which I encourage to read!
Uniform Sampling Consider \(N\) data points uniformly distributed in a \(p\)-dimensional unit ball centered at the origin. Suppose we consider a nearest-neighbor estimate at the origin.</description>

      <description>Nowadays social media generates a vast amount of raw data (text, images, videos, etc). It is a very interesting challenge to discover techniques to get insights on the content and development of social media data. In addition, as a fundamental component of the analysis, it is important to find ways of communicating the results, i.e. data visualization. In this post I want to present a small case study where I analyze Twitter text data.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to present the notion of curse of dimensionality following a suggested exercise (Chapter 4 - Ex. 4) of the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning, written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
When the number of features \(p\) is large, there tends to be a deterioration in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test observation for which a prediction must be made.</description>

      <description>We explore how to include an R notebook into a pelican post. As an example, we describe how to fit a circle onto a cloud of points.</description>
