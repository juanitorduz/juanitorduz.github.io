      <description>Here I want to share the recording and slides of the webinar Bayesian Methods in Modern Marketing Analytics in collaboration with PyMC Labs.
Abstract: During the webinar, we will discuss some of the most crucial topics in marketing analytics: media spend optimization through media mix models and experimentation, and customer lifetime value estimation. We will approach these topics from a Bayesian perspective, as it gives us great tools to have better models and more actionable insights.</description>
