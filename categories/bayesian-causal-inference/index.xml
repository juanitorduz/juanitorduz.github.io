      <title>Using Data Science for Bad Decision-Making: A Case Study</title>

      <description>You will probably be intrigued by the title of this post. In this notebook I do not want to present a fancy data science trick or to test a novel technique. I would simply like to tell a story. A story about how data science can be used to make bad decisions. “How can this be?” you might ask. Everyone has been saying that data is the way to unlock insights to gain a competitive advantage.</description>

      <title>Regression Discontinuity with GLMs and Kernel Weighting</title>

      <description>In this notebook we explore regression discontinuity design using generalized linear models (GLMs) and kernel weighting from a bayesian perspective. The motivation comes from applications when:
The data does not fit the usual linear regression OLS normal likelihood (e.g. modeling count data). The data size is limited.  In addition, we experiment with kernel weighting to weight the data points near the cutoff more heavily. This is a common technique in RD analysis, but it is not always clear how to do this with GLMs in the bayesian framework.</description>

      <title>ATE Estimation for Count Data</title>

      <description>This notebook is a continuation of the previous notebook on ATE estimation for binary data with logistic regression based on the sequence of (great!) posts by Solomon Kurz. In this notebook, we will focus on count data. We reproduce in python an example presented in the post Causal inference with count regression by Solomon Kurz. Our intention is to simply show how to port these type of model to bambi.</description>

      <description>In this notebook, I want to reproduce some components of the extensive blog post Causal inference with Bayesian models by Solomon Kurz. Specifically, I want to deep dive into the logistic regression model used to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of the study Internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection (e-STI) testing and results service: A randomised, single-blind, controlled trial by Wilson, et.al. I can only recommend to read the original sequence of posts Solomon has written on causal inference.</description>

      <title>Experimentation, Non-Compliance and Instrumental Variables with PyMC</title>

      <guid>/iv_pymc/</guid>
      <description>In this notebook we present an example of how to use PyMC to estimate the effect of a treatment in an experiment where there is non-compliance through the use of instrumental variables.
By non-compliance we mean that the treatment assignment does not guarantee that the treatment is actually received by the treated. The main challenge is that we can not simply estimate the treatment effect as a difference in means since the non-compliance mechanism is most of the time not at random and may introduce confounders.</description>

      <title>Cohort Revenue &amp; Retention Analysis: A Bayesian Approach</title>

      <guid>/revenue_retention/</guid>
      <description>In this notebook we extend the cohort retention model presented in the post Cohort Retention Analysis with BART so that we just model retention and per cohort simultaneously (we recommend reading the referenced post before this one). The idea is to keep modeling the retention using a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model (see pymc-bart) and linearly model the revenue per cohort using a Gamma distribution. We couple the retention and revenue components in a similar way as presented in the notebook Introduction to Bayesian A/B Testing.</description>

      <description>In this notebook we study an alternative approach for the cohort analysis problem presented in A Simple Cohort Retention Analysis in PyMC. Instead of using a linear model to estimate the retention rate, we use a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model(see pymc-bart). The BART model is a flexible non-parametric model that can be used to model complex relationships between the response and the predictors.

      <title>A Simple Cohort Retention Analysis in PyMC</title>

      <guid>/retention/</guid>
      <description>In this notebook we present a simple approach to study cohort retention analysis through a simulated data set. The aim is to understand how retention rates change over time and provide a simple model to predict them (with uncertainty estimates!). We do not expect this technique to be a silver bullet for all retention problems, but rather a simple approach to get started with the problem.
Remark: A motivation for this notebook was the great post Bayesian Age/Period/Cohort Models in Python with PyMC by Austin Rochford.</description>

      <title>Geo-Experimentation via Time Based Regression in PyMC</title>

      <description>Introduction In this notebook I describe and present an implementation of the time based regression (TBR) approach to marketing campaign analysis in the context of geo experimentation presented in the paper Estimating Ad Effectiveness using Geo Experiments in a Time-Based Regression Framework by Jouni Kerman, Peng Wang and Jon Vaver (Google, Inc. 2017). I strongly recommend reading the paper as it is quite clear in the exposition of the approach and presents some simulation results.</description>
