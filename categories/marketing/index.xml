      <description> In October 2022 I had the opportunity to give a talk at the Helsinki Data Science Meetup hosted by Wolt. Here I want to share the recording of my talk.
Abstract: The talk will show how to measure offline campaigns using causal inference techniques. In particular it’ll focus on tapping into the potential of synthetic control, geo-experiments via time-based regression, and Google’s Causal-Impact Method.
